# Create Express CLI

A Golang-powered CLI tool to instantly scaffold a ready-to-use **Express.js** application — with optional **TypeScript** support — so you can skip repetitive setup and jump straight into coding.

# Motivation behind this project
I’m way too lazy to set up the same Express project every time.  
So instead of doing `npm init` + installing packages + writing the same boilerplate for the millionth time,
I made this.

## 🚀 Features
- Generate a **JavaScript** or **TypeScript** Express app in seconds.
- Preconfigured middleware, routes, and project structure.
- Automatic `npm install` after scaffolding.
- Supports multiple templates (`express-basic`, `express-ts`).
- Clean and maintainable Golang CLI architecture.



## 📦 Getting Started (Recommended)

The easiest way to use `create-express-app` is with `npx`, which comes bundled with Node.js.

Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npx @aungkyawphyo/create-express-app my-awesome-project --typescript
```

This single command will download the CLI, create a new directory named my-awesome-project, and scaffold your new application inside it.


# Usage
Once your project is created, navigate into the new directory and start the development server:
```bash
cd my-awesome-project
npm run dev
```
